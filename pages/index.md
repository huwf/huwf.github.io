This is my personal site. This is mainly going to be notes of things I'm learning, or have learned.
I was inspired by the blue book https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/, which does not use the
blogging format so much, rather contains a documentation around a variety of subjects but not
necessarily in any sort of chronological order.
I think it's safe to assume that anything I've written here is not completed yet - including this page.

Occasionally I may include some blog posts too, for specific benchmarking things or gotchas
I've found.
