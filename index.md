This is my personal site which I intend to mainly use as a reference for myself, and to record my thoughts behind any
number of projects I think are cool or things I learn. Most likely, it'll be the same as most other tech blogs on 
t'internet where I ignore it once I've got a nice workflow to write and publish posts. I'm starting with using 
[Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) for the static site generation, because it's simple, allows me to write in markdown, 
and supports Jupyter notebook natively. It's pretty cool.

If against the odds I do keep going with this site, and I do write stuff, I hope to include stuff I am learning about, 
interesting problems I think about, or long-running perennially unfinished projects. In particular:

* Python programming. It is my day job after all, I'm sure I'll end up forgetting useful things that it'll be nice to
come back here and find them again
* Chess AI. I'd love to write my own bot
* Learning about maths I should have done years ago like linear algebra and calculus
* Learning about Haskell
* Climate change. I don't want to be interested but you can't really get away from it
